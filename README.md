# HTTP Load Tester Collection

HTTP load testing tool with implementations in Go, Rust, Zig, and Python. This repository explores different approaches to building high-performance load testers, providing tools to benchmark web services and compare language/runtime characteristics for this type of workload. Key metrics like RPS, success/failure counts, and response latencies are tracked.

## Implementations

This repository contains separate implementations of the load tester in the following languages:

*   **Go:** See the `go/` directory.
*   **Rust:** See the `rust/` directory.
*   **Zig:** See the `zig/` directory.
*   **Python:** See the `python/` directory.

## Features (General)

While specific features might vary slightly between implementations, the general goals include:

*   Configurable number of concurrent threads/workers.
*   Configurable number of requests per thread.
*   Customizable target URL.
*   Support for authentication tokens (e.g., Bearer token).
*   Collection and display of performance metrics.
*   Payload for POST requests (e.g., from `payload.json`).

## Metrics Collected

The load testers aim to collect and report the following metrics:

*   **Total Test Duration:** Overall time taken for the test to complete.
*   **Total Requests:** The total number of requests made.
*   **Successful Requests:** Count of requests that completed successfully (e.g., HTTP 200 OK, 201 Created).
*   **Failed Requests:** Count of requests that failed.
*   **Requests Per Second (RPS):** The rate at which requests were processed.
*   **Response Time Statistics (ms):**
    *   Minimum response time.
    *   Average response time.
    *   Maximum response time.

## Zig Implementation (`zig/`)

The Zig version utilizes `std.http.Client` for making HTTP requests and `dotenv.zig` for managing configuration through a `.env` file. The JSON payload is embedded into the executable at compile time.

### Prerequisites

*   Zig compiler (e.g., version 0.14.1 or later). You can download it from [ziglang.org](https://ziglang.org/download/).

### Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `zig/` directory with the following variables:

    ```dotenv
    # Number of concurrent threads to use
    NUM_THREADS=20

    # Number of requests each thread will make
    REQUESTS_PER_THREAD=50

    # Target URL for the load test
    TARGET_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/foo"

    # (Optional) Authentication token (Bearer token)
    AUTH_TOKEN=""
    ```
2.  Ensure a `payload.json` file is present in the `zig/src/` directory. This file contains the JSON body for POST requests and will be embedded by the compiler.

### Building and Running

Navigate to the `zig/` directory and run:

```bash
zig build run
```
This command will compile (embedding `zig/src/payload.json`) and run the load tester. Ensure the `.env` file is configured in `zig/`.

### Example Output (Zig)

```
info: 🚀 Starting load test (Zig v0.14+ with std.http.Client & dotenv.zig)...

```

## Go Implementation (`go/`)

The Go version uses the standard `net/http` package and `github.com/joho/godotenv` for configuration.

### Prerequisites

*   Go (e.g., version 1.18 or newer).

### Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `go/` directory with the following variables (or set them as environment variables):

    ```dotenv
    # Number of concurrent threads to use
    NUM_THREADS=20

    # Number of requests each thread will make
    REQUESTS_PER_THREAD=50

    # Target URL for the load test
    TARGET_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/foo"

    # (Optional) Authentication token (Bearer token)
    AUTH_TOKEN=""
    ```
2.  Ensure a `payload.json` file is present in the `go/` directory.

### Building and Running

Navigate to the `go/` directory and run:

```bash
# Build the executable
go build -o go_load_tester main.go

# Run the load tester
./go_load_tester
```
Ensure the `.env` file (if used) and `payload.json` are in the `go/` directory when running.

---

## Rust Implementation (`rust/`)

The Rust version uses the `reqwest` crate for HTTP requests and the `dotenv` crate for configuration.

### Prerequisites

*   Rust (e.g., latest stable version).
*   Cargo (Rust's package manager).

### Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `rust/` directory with the following variables (or set them as environment variables):

    ```dotenv
    # Number of concurrent threads to use
    NUM_THREADS=20

    # Number of requests each thread will make
    REQUESTS_PER_THREAD=50

    # Target URL for the load test
    TARGET_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/foo"

    # (Optional) Authentication token (Bearer token)
    AUTH_TOKEN=""
    ```
2.  Ensure a `payload.json` file is present in the `rust/` directory.

### Building and Running

Navigate to the `rust/` directory and run:

```bash
# Build the executable (optimized release build)
cargo build --release

# Run the load tester
./target/release/rust_load_tester
```
Ensure the `.env` file (if used) and `payload.json` are in the `rust/` directory when running the compiled executable.

---

## Python Implementation (`python/`)

The Python version uses the `requests` library for HTTP calls, `python-dotenv` for configuration, and `threading` for concurrency.

### Prerequisites

*   Python (e.g., version 3.8 or newer recommended).
*   `pip` (Python package installer).

### Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `python/` directory with the following variables (or set them as environment variables):

    ```dotenv
    # Number of concurrent threads to use
    NUM_THREADS=20

    # Number of requests each thread will make
    REQUESTS_PER_THREAD=50

    # Target URL for the load test
    TARGET_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/foo"

    # (Optional) Authentication token (Bearer token)
    AUTH_TOKEN=""
    ```
2.  Ensure a `payload.json` file is present in the `python/` directory.

### Building and Running

Navigate to the `python/` directory and run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the load tester
python main.py
```
Ensure the `.env` file (if used) and `payload.json` are in the `python/` directory when running.
